Mind the "in DBZ" part of the question. We're not referring to Dragon Ball Super transformations - not in this quiz, anyway. Although there were still greater heights waiting for the Saiyan prince once Dragon Ball Z would wrap up, we're only interested in whether you know what level he achieved in the series. Was it as great as Goku's ultimate DBZ SSJ transformation, or was it even greater? If you're only a casual fan, you might have some trouble here.</p>
<h2 class="question-title">During the Saiyan Saga, how does Goku reach King Kai's planet?</h2>

<p>To start, let's think way back to the Saiyan Saga of the Dragon Ball Z series, where this whole adventure began. As you know, the arrival of Raditz on planet Earth meant the early death of our hero Goku, although things didn't end for him there. After he passed on, his mission was to receive training from King Kai in order to prepare for the arrival of two Saiyans even stronger than Raditz. What's the only way our hero can reach King Kai?</p>
<h2 class="question-title">What item is used to restore a wounded Z fighter to full health?</h2>

<form id="question3">
      
          <input name="gender" value="correct" type="radio"> Senzu bean<br>
          <input name="gender" value="incorrect" type="radio">Senzu bean Way<br>

<p>In the world of Dragon Ball Z, brave warriors must face insurmountable odds in battle in order to ensure the prevalence of the human race. With that kind of setup, it only makes sense that our heroes would find themselves injured time and time again - and they do, for sure. This is why the existence of a certain medicinal item in the series is so useful. Indeed, without it, planet Earth might have turned into space rubble a long time ago.</P>
<h2 class="question-title">Where is Goku when he transforms into a Super Saiyan for the first time?</h2>

<p>As is prophesied in the opening sequence of the Dragon Ball Z series right from the first episode, an epic Super Saiyan transformation is in the cards for our hero Goku. He'll need it desperately in order to make it past a certain opponent, but we won't say much more than that. Anyone who watched this sequence of the series with open mouths like millions of others will definitely be able to get this question right. So what will it be?</p>
